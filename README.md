Description:

This project proposes an automated music genre classification system using machine learning techniques. The system uses a dataset of audio samples to extract features, which are then used to train various algorithms. The system evaluates the performance of each classifier and provides real-time feedback. The systemâ€™s effectiveness is demonstrated, and the results suggest potential for further enhancements. This project contributes to the advancement of automated music genre classification systems, improving music content organization and retrieval in digital libraries and streaming platforms. \par
